  What if you could find your center, even on the most demanding days?  


  When your world moves fast, a moment of peace is your greatest asset. We’ve
  created Vase—a beautiful, private space for that moment.  


  Vase isn't another meditation app. It's your discreet, 3-minute emotional
  reset designed for the workplace. Gently pour a stressful feeling into your
  Vase to immediately quiet the noise and regain your focus. The feeling is
  safely held, not dismissed, giving you the clarity to excel in the moment.  


  Later, when you have time, explore what's inside. Our premium suite goes
  beyond simple tracking by connecting your feelings to your body's needs.
  Discover personalized nutrition, activity, and reflection
  prompts—science-backed insights that build lasting resilience from the inside
  out.  


  **Vase.** **Your feelings are welcome here.**
