  From a Great Career to a Fulfilling Future


  Life as a high-performer can leave you feeling caught between two questions:


  * Is your demanding job draining your health and personal life?

  * Are you questioning your career path, wanting more but paralyzed by
  uncertainty?


  You have the ambition. What you need is a clear strategy.


  Think of me as your confidential thinking partner. I don't give you the
  answers; I help you find your own. Together, we will cut through the noise,
  create a practical roadmap for your next chapter, and build the confidence to
  act on it.


  I know the pressure you're under because I've been thereâ€”my path led from the
  academia, to the World Bank, then to a 6-year product role at TikTok. As an
  ICF Certified Life Coach, I now combine that firsthand experience with a
  professional framework to help you move forward.


  Ready for clarity? Let's talk.
